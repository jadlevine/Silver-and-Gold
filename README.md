### **_Getting Started_**

Players start with 4 Treasure Maps. Select two to begin. On player turn, explore regions on one of your Treasure Maps according to the the exploration tile pattern. The patterns may be rotated and/or mirrorer. Regions on Treasure Maps can only be explored once. Players may chose to explore a single region instead of using the current exploration pattern.

Once a Treasure Map has been completely explored, it is complete. Select a new Treasure Map to explore from the Market, or select a random Map from the Treasure Maps Deck.

Points are scored from completed Treasure Maps, Map bonuses, gems, and coconuts. The player with the most points at the end of 4 rounds is the winner.
