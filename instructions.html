    <p id="intro"> Arrr! It's a Pirates life for you! In this game you will play as an adventuring swashbuckler looking for glory and gems! You will go from island to island, following your treasure maps to explore different regions in your quest for hidden treasure.</p>
    <p><b>Game Setup: </b>Choose TWO of the four Treasure Maps to Begin</p>
    <p><b>Exploring: </b>On your Turn, explore regions on your treasure maps by clicking on your maps to place the current exploration tile</p>
    <p><b>Explore One Tile Option: </b>If you cannot or do not want to place the current exploration tile, you may instead choose to explore just one area</p>

    <p><b>Bonuses: </b>Some cards have bonuses in the upper right corner. These count for the number of points listed on OTHER cards you have completed according to their suit/color</p>
    <p><b>End of a Round: </b>End of a Round: after 7 of the 8 Exploration tiles have been placed, the round it over</p>
